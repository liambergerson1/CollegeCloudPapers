<h1>Colorado State University - Global Cloud Computing and Virtualization Papers</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Throughout my college career at Colorado State University - Global, I have written many papers relating to Cloud Computing and Virtualization such as basic fundamentals, deployment models, service models, popular cloud vendors, virtual machines, etc. I would like to showcase what I have learned throughout my college career as it relates to Cloud Computing and Virtualization A brief description of each paper will be provided as well as the full paper being attached.

<h2>Best Cloud-Based Solution</h2>
This paper delves into the complexities of transitioning from traditional, on-premises data centers to cloud-based solutions, discussing various deployment models (private, public, hybrid, community), cloud service models (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS), data storage, security measures, management aspects, and solution design considerations. It emphasizes the critical factors to evaluate while considering cloud migration, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each cloud deployment and service model to determine the optimal fit for an organization's needs.

<h2>Cloud Security for a Retail Company</h2>
This paper evaluates the security aspects concerning the fictional company, ABC Company's, transition to Amazon Web Services (AWS) for migrating their data and applications to the cloud. It covers various threats and vulnerabilities in cloud environments, focusing on misconfigurations, Denial of Service (DoS)/Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, wireless network encryption, and cyber attack prevention. Additionally, it proposes mitigation strategies such as logging, auditing, network monitoring, firewalls, and multi-factor authentication to address these security concerns in the context of AWS usage.

<h2>Data Security in Cloud Platforms</h2>
This paper delves into cloud platform security, discussing evolving threats and the need for proactive measures to protect private and public cloud models. It emphasizes the implementation of encryption, robust account security practices, and network security measures involving firewalls and intrusion detection systems. The simplicity and security considerations across private, public, and hybrid cloud platforms are outlined, highlighting the varying responsibilities between organizations and cloud providers. Additionally, it presents best practices for hypervisor security, focusing on patch management, secure communications, and user access control.

<h2>Enterprise Virtualization Implementation Proposal for Solar
Panel Manufacturing Company</h2>
This paper details an enterprise virtualization proposal for a fictional solar panel manufacturing company. It aims to transition the existing physical architecture to a virtual environment to facilitate expansion and service offering to other organizations. Key aspects covered include application deployment using a three-tier architecture-virtual design, leveraging virtual appliances like Percona Server for enhanced database security, achieving high availability through failover clustering and load balancing, addressing challenges in transitioning to a virtual infrastructure, and outlining a virtual infrastructure design with NIC teaming for traffic balancing and reliability.

<h2>International Cloud Operations</h2>
This paper delves into evaluating three prominent cloud vendors, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud, for a Fortune 500 company planning to migrate services and data to the cloud. It thoroughly discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each vendor, highlighting Azure's high availability, scalability, and security features, AWS's flexibility, reliability, and security limitations, and Google Cloud's reliability, SSL certificates, and resource isolation. Ultimately, it recommends Microsoft Azure as the best choice for this organization due to its versatility, integration capabilities, and strengths that align with the company's global operations and migration goals.

<h2>Reducing the Risk of Failure of a Cloud-Migration Project</h2>
This paper focuses on reducing the risk of failure in a cloud migration project by addressing key elements like log management and virtualization integration. It emphasizes the importance of efficient log management, detailing its phases and benefits, while also highlighting challenges such as data volume and indexing latency. Additionally, it outlines a strategic approach for integrating virtualization into workflows, emphasizing careful planning, the use of free cloud services for testing, and the importance of creating processes and criteria for efficient deployment and maintenance in a virtualized environment.

<h2>Security of Data on the Cloud</h2>
This paper emphasizes the growing significance of data security, especially with the increasing shift to cloud storage. It explores essential security solutions like Identity and Access Management (IAM), Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and encryption techniques for data-at-rest and in-transit. IAM is detailed as a centralized system managing user access, while DLP strategies focus on preventing data loss or unauthorized access. Encryption techniques for data-at-rest and in-transit are discussed to safeguard data confidentiality and integrity. Overall, the paper highlights the crucial role these methods play in protecting sensitive data as organizations transition to cloud storage solutions.

<h2>The Impact Of Cloud Computing On IT Auditing</h2>
This paper explores the impact of cloud computing on IT auditing, highlighting challenges and concerns. It emphasizes the complexities faced when auditing cloud service providers due to limitations and restrictions imposed by providers. The discussion delves into various cloud service models, their associated risks, and the struggles auditors face in ensuring adequate auditing practices. Additionally, it touches upon certifications like the Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK) as a means to enhance IT auditors' skill sets, addressing cloud security issues, and the importance of auditing cloud platforms with the same scrutiny as traditional data centers.
